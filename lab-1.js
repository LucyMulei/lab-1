// Question 1: Define a function called "calculateArea" that takes two parameters, "length" and "width", and returns the area of a rectangle.

// Question 2: Call the "calculateArea" function with arguments 5 and 3, and store the result in a variable called "rectangleArea".

// Question 3: Define a function called "greetUser" that takes one parameter, "name", and logs a greeting message to the console using that name eg. "Hello, John!".

// Question 5: Define a global variable called "globalVar" and assign it the value "I'm a global variable".

// Question 6: Define a function called "localScopeExample" that logs the value of the global variable "globalVar" and defines a local variable called "localVar" with the value "I'm a local variable" and logs it to the console.

// Question 8: Try to access the "localVar" variable outside of the "localScopeExample" function. What happens?

// localVar is not defined because it is a local variable and only exists within the localScopeExample function.

// Question 9: Write an if-else statement that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero. Log the result to the console.

// Question 10: Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a number greater than 100. Keep asking until the user enters a valid number.
